        "\n",
        "* Each tree is trained on a **random subset** of the data (bagging).\n",
        "* At each split in the tree, a **random subset of features** is considered (feature randomness).\n",
        "* The final output is decided by **majority voting** (for classification) or **average prediction** (for regression).\n",

        "Actually, Random Forest itself is one algorithm, but depending on the task, we can categorize it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Random Forest Classifier** – Used when the target is categorical (e.g., disease prediction, spam detection).\n",
        "2. **Random Forest Regressor** – Used when the target is numerical (e.g., predicting stock price, house price).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Reduces Overfitting** – Multiple trees average out the noise.\n",
        "2. **Handles Missing Values & Outliers** well.\n",
        "3. **Works with Large Datasets** – Can handle thousands of features.\n",
        "4. **Good Accuracy** – Performs well in both classification and regression.\n",
        "5. **Feature Importance** – Helps in feature selection by ranking variable importance.\n",

        "* **Compared to Logistic Regression** → Random Forest handles nonlinear relationships better.\n",
        "* **Compared to SVM** → Random Forest is faster on large datasets with many features.\n",
        "* **Compared to Neural Networks** → Random Forest requires less data preprocessing and is easier to interpret.\n"
